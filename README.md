# Chat With WebSockets 

- Make sure that you wait a few seconds until the Demo loads.
- Open a few different tabs and see that different users can text each other. 

Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.

## Try to open multiple tabs on your browser, and see that it works with different users. Works on mobile as well.

This makes Web Sockets 
perfect for chats.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ben-C3012/Chat-Socket-IO-V2.git

```

## Usage
